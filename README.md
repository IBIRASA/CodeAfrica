## COA TASKFORCE - TAKE HOME CHALLENGE

This project focused on coding solutions for three unique challenges. With the goal of generating specific outputs, I approached each problem systematically, leveraging coding techniques to achieve desired results efficiently and effectively.

#1 Challenge I: Photo Gallery
    
   This project involves creating a simple, yet elegant photo gallery using HTML and CSS. The gallery is designed to be responsive, ensuring that images look great on devices of all sizes.

   ---> Features:

       Responsive Design: The gallery adjusts its layout automatically based on the screen size, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

       Flexbox Layout: Images are displayed in a clean flexbox layout, making it easy to browse through the photos.

       Hover Effects: Each photo has a subtle hover effect to enhance user interaction and visual appeal.

       CSS Styling: Custom CSS is used to style the gallery, including image borders, shadows, and spacing to create a cohesive look.

   ---> Technologies Used:

        HTML: To structure the gallery and embed the images.

        CSS: For styling the gallery, including layout, hover effects, and responsiveness.

#2 Challenge II:ArrayMap

   This project is a simple web app to check if an array has a contiguous subarray that sums to a given target value.

       HTML: Form with inputs for the array and target sum, a button to check, and a result display.

       JavaScript: Functions to check for the subarray and display the result.

       CSS: Basic styling to center and style the form.

   ---> How to Use:

       Enter a comma-separated array and a target sum.

       Click the "Check" button.

       See the result indicating if such a subarray exists.


#3 Challenge III: String Transform

   This project is a simple web application that lets users input a string and see it transformed. Key features include:

      Responsive Design: Works well on all devices and screen sizes.

      User Interaction: Users can enter a string and click a button to transform it.

      Modern Web Technologies: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

   ---> This script modifies a given string based on its length:

      If the length is divisible by 3, it reverses the entire string.

      If the length is divisible by 5, it replaces each character with its ASCII code.

      If the length is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), it first reverses the entire string and then replaces each character with its ASCII code.

   ---> How to Use:

       Enter a string in the input field.
    
       Click the "Transform" button.
    
       View the modified string in the result area.
